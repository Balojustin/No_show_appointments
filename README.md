## Summary of findings
In the first question where I explored how age affects showing up for appointments, the analysis showed that though the senior adults have the smallest appointment bookings amongst the four age groups, they are more likely to show up for their appointment when compared to the other age groups while the young adults, though with the most appointment bookings of the four age groups are the least likely to show up for an appointment.

I then checked the influence of when the appointment booking is made had on showing up for the appointment. This showed that while most people are likely to book for their appointment after the appointment day, people like this are the most likely to show-up. The proportion of people that show up for their appointment also decreases as the scheduled day gets farther from the appointment day.

Lastly, I checked the effect being hypertensive or not has on showing up for an appointment in the senior adult population and I saw that there is no significant difference in whether a senior_adult will show up for their appointment based on their hypertensive status, as about an equal proportion of both groups go for their appointment.
